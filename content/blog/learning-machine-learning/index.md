Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have been huge buzzwords in the Tech industry for [quite some time](https://towardsdatascience.com/google-trends-on-data-science-160146fea72a). Hearing them might make you picture self-driving cars or chat bots in your head and leave you wondering what kind of programming goes into those projects. AI in particular has been the stuff of science fiction for so long that it's hard not to be curious about it now that we're seeing real life projects surface in the news.

But what do those terms really mean? A cursory search of any of them will undoubtedly leave you separating science from marketing before you get to any valuable information. I've spent the past few months learning and researching Machine Learning and the Data Science field, so I know how difficult it can be to drill through the buzz and hype. This article is about that experience and how far I was able to get as a humble JavaScript developer.

Before we get started though, I want to kick things off with my favorite quote about Machine Learning and AI:

> Difference between machine learning and AI:
>
> If it is written in Python, it's probably machine learning
>
> If it is written in PowerPoint, it's probably AI

## I thought Machine Learning was only for geniuses (and I'm no genius)

I first started working with Machine Learning (ML) early on in my developer career when working with a team that was doing text-recognition work. My job was to use JavaScript to create a front-end application for the users to use when sending documents to the backend for parsing.

Python is the main squeeze when it comes to ML/AI work for a lot of reasons, so I did not expect to get much experience in the ML realm. However, some research started to show me that ML was making its way into the JavaScript realm as well. Not only could you use trained models to predict data in the browser, but Tensorflow itself had a JavaScript implementation that would let you create and train models.

However, while it was awesome to see that JavaScript can really do all the things, Machine Learning is a specialized field that has massive foundations in calculus and statistics. So while I felt competent in my JavaScript abilities, I am definitely incompetent when it comes to higher level math I haven't touched since college. Because of the heavy maths involved in ML, I figured the whole field was beyond me as a humble front-end developer.
