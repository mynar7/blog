Console Confessional\n\nMe and console.log‚Ä¶","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Debug JavaScript Quickly","date":"August 12, 2019"},"body":"\n![Photo of fire ants](./fireants.jpg)\n\nIf you've ever thought, *\"meh... I'm fine with* `console.log`*, learning to debug is as painful as rolling in fire ants\"*, this article is for you!\n\n## Console Confessional\n\nMe and `console.log` are like this: ü§û. It's been my go-to solution for all things weirdJS from the start: `this`, de-nesting API call data, `async` things, timeouts, etc.\n\nHowever, once upon a time, my bootcamp teacher showed us debugging briefly (thank you James), and I thought, *\"This is... **really cool**\"*.\n\nYou could see **everything** happening inside your code while it's executing--how useful!\n\nUnfortunately I soon got into node-land and then front-end framework valley. I quickly gave up on debugging. (Configure VS Code debugger anyone? Webpack? *...No thanks.*)\n\nAnd that was üëå for a while. I'd hit an issue, fire off a `console.log` or three, solve it, and go back through the code to delete them. Sometimes issues would require many more console.logs. Sometimes my boss would giggle when one slipped into a Pull Request; I'd feel bad, delete/re-push, and go back to `console.log`-ing.\n\nI've probably typed `console.log` more than any other syntax, word, or punctuation in my time coding JavaScript. I've typed it so much I've thought about installing an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log) to save myself keystrokes.\n\nThere's also a ton of useful `console.log` tricks out there. I've used `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.table`, destructring, used CSS in logs, and [many more](https://kylegill.com/blog/2018-11-20-commanding-the-javascript-console/index).\n\nBut what happens when that's just not enough? What if you're tired of typing *\"c o n s o l e . l o g\"* everytime you hit a snag?\n\n## console.gone\n\nAt work recently, we realized our production code had a memory leak. Our wonderful production code that was compiled and transpiled with webpack, stuffed into a docker container, and running in a linux environment somewhere in AWS land.\n\nWhere was my wonderful `console.log` in all that mess?\n\nGone, friend. Gone.\n\nLong story short, we got deep into Chrome's performance tooling (a topic for another article?). Through that, **I finally found a quick path to connecting node/webpack and chrome dev tools.**\n\nSince then I've found myself using more `debugger` statements in my day-to-day.\n\n## Basic Debugging with Chrome\n\nOK. For anyone that's unfamiliar, first we're going to start with the basics. How do you actually open the chrome debugger?\n\n1. First, **open dev tools on this site.**\n    - Press f12, right-click and select \"inspect\", press ctrl-shift-i on Windows or cmd-clover-unnatural-hand-movement on Mac... just get the dev tools open however you normally do.\n1. **Add a** `debugger` **statement to your code**. (I've already done this below)\n    - Chrome will pick up on any debugger statements, pause the code, and open the debugging tools while code is running **if (and only if)** dev tools are already open.\n1. **Run the code!**\n    * Click ‚Üó‚Üò or ‚û° to step through the code line by line\n    * Click the ‚ñ∂ to resume the script\n\n\n```js js-live\nfunction doStuff(thing) {\n    thing = thing / 4 * -1\n    thing = Math.pow(thing, 1)\n    const thing2 = Math.trunc(thing) + 5\n    debugger // <-- this makes the magic happen\n    return thing2\n}\n\nconst thingamajig = Math.random()\nconst result = doStuff(thingamajig)\nconsole.log(\"And the result is...\" + result)\n```\n\n#### Pretty cool right? üòéüëç\n\nNotice how the debugger prints the values of the code as you step through it. Very very nice! This can save you many many keystrokes if you're trying to dig down into an object.\n\nWhy don't we check out some more basic debugging examples?\n\n## Checking out variable values\n\nYou can hover over variables in the debugger and see their value as you step through the code.\n\nFirst let's look at some HTML:\n\n```html html-live\n<div id=\"magical\">Boooooring</div>\n```\n\nNow let's watch some JavaScript spice things up in the html above. Try stepping through to the \"awesome\" variable, then hovering over it to see all the magical properties and methods a DOM object has attached to it.\n\n(Don't forget to use ‚Üó‚Üò to step through, and ‚ñ∂ when you're finished)\n\n```js js-live\ndebugger // Let's watch the magic happen~ ‚ú®üëè\nconst div = document.getElementById('magical')\nconst awesome = document.createElement('marquee')\n//I'm I-remember-marquee-tags years old. ü§´\nawesome.innerHTML = '<h2>‚ú®üöÄ~MAGICAL~ ü¶Ñüåà</h2>'\ndiv.textContent = \"\" //boring no more...\ndiv.appendChild(awesome)\n```\n## Nested Properties\n\nTrying to find a nested property on an object? Debugging can help!\n\nLet's try and get... oh, let's say the level of sweetness on this meatball object below.\n\nIt would take me a *lot* of `console.log`s to finally drill down to that... but there's a better way!\n\nDebug, Hover the variable, then expand the properties until you find the key you're looking for then **Right-Click** and select **Copy Property Path**\n\n```js js-live\nconst meatball = {\n    ingredients: {\n        spices: [\"Oregano\", \"Italian\", \"Mystery\"],\n        meats: {\n            beef: {\n                freeRange: true,\n                happy: \"yes, until it was time to make meatballs\",\n            }\n        },\n    },\n    flavors: [\n        {\n            umami: {\n                level: \"???\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            savory: {\n                level: 8\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            sweet: {\n                level: Math.floor(Math.random() * 9)\n            }\n        },\n    ]\n}\n//look up where we assign the meatball variable\n//hover over meatball, and start opening up properties until you get to sweetness\n//then right-click on \"level\" and choose \"copy property path\"\n//paste it after meatball below:\ndebugger\nconsole.log(\"Mama makes a meatball that's \" + /*meatball.<paste here and uncomment>*/ + \"/9 in sweetness\")\n//don't forget to erase the debugger when you run it!\n```\n\n## Blackboxing üì¶ and React ‚öõ\n\nWant to debug React? No problem! You can use the same workflow as above, even when using a framework like React or Vue. Just drop a **debugger** statement in, **open dev tools**, and **run** it!\n\n#### A small catch\n\nOK, there's one minor note I have to make. We want to debug, *our* code, and not React's code, right? However, the debugger will step through **all** of the code that's running, not just yours. So you might find yourself in some weird React code as you're stepping through your component.\n\nNo sweat! There's ways to handle that. Try these tips:\n\n* Lost in a weird script? Click ‚¨Ü to \"Step out\" of a function and hopefully back up to a recognizeable script.\n* Still lost? Look at the **Call Stack** Panel. The scripts here are the ones you're currently stepping through. In some weird script? **Right-click** and select **\"Blackbox script\"** to skip debugging the script you're in.\n\nTry it below!\n\n```js react-live\nfunction Counter() {\n    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)\n    function countUp(count) {\n        debugger\n        const newCount = count + 1\n        setCount(newCount)\n    }\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h2>Count is {count}</h2>\n            <button onClick={() => countUp(count)}>Increment</button>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n```\n\n## But what about Node?\n\nAh yes... the eternal question. How does one debug NodeJS?\n\nYou can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging), you can use a neat tool called [NDB](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb), but I say we just use chrome and move on with our lives.\n\n(Note: I personally always confuse \"ndb\" and \"nbd\" as in \"No Big Deal\", instead of \"node debugger\", and it makes me nuts. I **always** mistype it, I can't google it, and so it makes a fool of me everytime I try to use it.)\n\n1. Open chrome and type `chrome://inspect`\n1. Then start your app with the `--inspect` flag.\n    * Ex: `node --inspect server.js`\n    * You should see something like: `Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/dfcsd4c63-123e-234-adsd-123lkdfgk`\n1. Go back to Chrome, you should see \"Remote Target\" and a file name/path to your file, plus a little `inspect` link. Click it! This should pop open a separate dev tools window.\n1. Add some debuggers to your code and go to town!\n\n**Note** You may have to close and re-open chrome's debug pane for your app if it doesn't detect your debugger statement on the first pass. I'm also on the latest version of chrome, and you should be too üòâ\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\nDebugging isn't always my first-line of defense against weird JavaScript, but I use it a lot more often now that I've got a decent workflow for it.\n\nHow do you debug code?

We haven't been around for very long, but we've had some great success reaching developers in our community and beyond with helpful advice and knowledge.\n\nI've been asked a few times about how to get started with a podcast, what our workflow is, what equipment we use, and generally how we do things for our show. I've also asked a lot of those questions myself and done a lot of research along the way to launching Tech Jr, so I figured it was time to boil that down into a blog post.\n\nI'm going to unload everything I've learned about making a podcast, so buckle up.\n\nBefore we start, a hot-take üî•:\n\n>When I run into an old friend, and I have no idea what they‚Äôve been up to, I just say, ‚ÄúI love your podcast.‚Äù Haven‚Äôt been wrong yet.\n\n>&mdash; [@fimoculous](https://twitter.com/fimoculous/status/1138182748735246337) June 10, 2019\n\n## Contents:\n* [Getting Started:](#essentials)\n  * [Offload it all](#option1)\n  * [Make your site, offload the rest](#option2)\n  * [Do it all yourself](#option3)\n    * [Website](#website)\n    * [File Hosting](#hosting)\n    * [RSS](#rss)\n  * [Analytics](#analytics)\n  * [Getting Sponsors](#sponsors)\n* [Getting Great Audio](#audio)\n  * [Picking a Microphone](#mic)\n  * [Recording and Editing](#software)\n  * [Interviews, Co-hosts, and Voip](#voip)\n    * [Zoom](#zoom)\n    * [Skype](#skype)\n    * [Zencastr](#zencastr)\n    * [Local](#local)\n* [Producing Great Content](#content)\n  * [Picking a Topic](#topic)\n  * [Consider your Audience](#audience)\n  * [Episode Preparation](#prep)\n  * [Staying Organized](#organizing)\n* [Promoting the Show](#promote)\n  * [Social Media](#social)\n  * [Newsletter/Email](#email)\n  * [Interviews/Guest Spots](#guestspots)\n  * [Ask your Listeners for Help](#ask)\n* [Reflections](#reflections)\n  * [It's hard work](#hardwork)\n  * [It takes time](#patience)\n  * [Perseverance](#persevere)\n  * [Feedback](#feedback)\n* [Parting Words](#credits)\n\n# <a name=\"essentials\"></a> The Essentials:\n\nThere's 3 main things you need to have a podcast:\n* A place to host your audio files\n* An RSS feed\n* A website\n\nThe website is technically optional, but people will expect you to have one. File hosting and RSS, however, are unavoidable and necessary.\n\n#### A note about the RSS feed:\n\nIf you want your show to be on itunes, spotify, google play, and beyond, you're going to need an RSS feed. RSS is just a bunch of xml tags similar to HTML that contains a list of your episodes and information about them like the  title, description, author, and where the audio file lives.\n\nItunes and other aggregators will consume this feed and use it to list your latest episodes on their platforms. Some will download your episode and host it themselves, while others will point listeners directly to your hosting solution. More importantly though, _other_ platforms will scrape itunes and re-list your show on _their_ platform.\n\nBasically this is all to say that RSS is incredibly important to your show, so do your research before you pick a solution for it.\n\n## What are my options for RSS, a website, and file hosting?\n\nI like to think there's 3 ways to tackle this. Which one you choose depends on how much money you want to pay and how much time you have to spend.\n\n(No judgements from me by the way on whichever you choose. Different strokes and all that.)\n\n<a name=\"option1\"></a>\n\n### Option 1: Pay the premium üíµ, move on with your life\n\nIf you're just looking to get your show on the air and don't care about the technical details, this is for you. There's some services out there that will absolutely take care of the whole enchilada for you for a monthly fee and provide an RSS feed, website, and file hosting.\n\n[Libsyn](https://libsyn.com/) and [Fireside.fm](https://fireside.fm/) are two common solutions in this space.\n\n<a name=\"option2\"></a>\n\n### Option 2: build the site yourself, pay for hosting.\n\nYou can absolutely build your own site and use a service to handle RSS and hosting. [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) has a [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) site and uses libsyn for RSS/hosting for example.\n\nThere's also [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm) that will handle hosting and provide some other goodies for you.\n\nThis is great if you want a beautiful, custom site but don't care about diving deep into RSS and file hosting.\n\n<a name=\"option3\"></a>\n\n### Option 3: DIY to the max; YOLO baby. üòé\n\nThen there's me. I'm so cheap I've been driving the same '98 civic coupe since college. It turned 21 this year. We've almost hit 200,000 miles together and I've saved many thousands of dollars on car payments. Me and that car are like ü§û.\n\nHowever, my beautiful, wonderful wife ***hates*** that car. It's tiny and she's claustrophobic. The interior is disintegrating to plastic chemical dust in the Florida heat. It has no A/C. Also, the windshield wiper motor no longer obeys the off switch, so when it rains I have to reach under the dash and jiggle the fuse to enable/disable the wipers.\n\nBasically, I'm willing to suffer a little to save a buck. ü§∑‚Äç\n\nI **host my own audio**, **built my own site**, and **create my own RSS feed**.\n\nIt was a lot of work, but it saves me üí∏üí∏üí∏.\n\n<a name=\"website\"></a>\n\n#### DIY Website: Netlify + Gridsome + Markdown\n\nI'm a front-end developer, so of course I made my own site. I used [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) to build a static site with markdown files for each episode.\n\nI host my site for **free** with [Netlify](https://netlify.com).\n\nWith the money saved on monthly website hosting, I splurged the extra two bucks on buying the domain through Netlify as well for free and easy SSL certs (https is important for RSS).\n\n<a name=\"hosting\"></a>\n\n#### DIY File Hosting: Amazon S3\n\nAmazon S3 is about the easiest thing you can do with AWS as a non-DevOps expert. This is as simple as creating a bucket for your show and setting it to be publically accessible. When you upload a file, S3 gives you a URL to access it at.\n\nAWS is great because cloud hosting means your files are being hosted by Amazon, and they're unlikely to experience an outage. It also means you're paying for usage, and not a flat monthly fee. I had something like 1800 requests last month to my audio files, and paid a whopping $2.58.\n\n<a name=\"rss\"></a>\n\n#### DIY RSS: Gridsome plugins / npm\n\nHmm, what about that pesky RSS feed?\n\nI used a [plugin](https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-rss) for Gridsome that itself uses an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss) for generating the XML for the RSS feed.\n\n\n**Note:** If you're not into Vue/Gridsome, [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org) (uses React) has a similar [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-an-rss-feed/) to get you going. (I built my [blog](https://leewarrick.com/blog) with Gatsby and use the RSS plugin to publish to [Dev.to](https://dev.to/leewarrickjr))\n\nWith Gridsome, my episode pages are generated from markdown, and at the top of those markdown files is some meta-information you can set using something called [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). This is where I include stuff like my description, file size, file location, episode length, tags, etc. The RSS plugin reads this during the build step and then runs a function to create the XML tags based on this info.\n\nItunes is picky about RSS, but you can read about what tags you need [here](https://www.feedforall.com/itune-tutorial-tags.htm), and they have a handy validator which will tell you if your feed is valid when you go to [submit it](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login?module=PodcastsConnect). Spotify and google will also validate your RSS before you submit, but generally follow the same rules as itunes.\n\nIf you want to check your RSS beforehand, there's a number of [helpful](https://castfeedvalidator.com/) [sites](https://podba.se/validate/) for that.\n\nIf you want to see a working example, [Tech Jr](https://techjr.dev)'s repo is public and you can see it on [Github](https://github.com/mynar7/techjr). Check out the `gridsome.plugin.js` file for RSS goodness.\n\n<a name=\"analytics\"></a>\n\n### Analytics\n\nIf you pay for file hosting through a service like libsyn or anchor, they will usually provide all your analytics in a neat little package with a bow on top.\n\nIf you went my route and host your own files, you're not totally lost, however.\n\nAWS offers analytics if you know where to look, and you'll at least get some usage statistics attached to your monthly bill (that's how they charge, after all).\n\nAlso, iTunes, Google, and Spotify will all give you analytics through their respective creator dashboards. (How did you think libsyn gets those numbers?)\n\nLastly, there's sites like [chartable](https://chartable.com) that will aggregate data from those disparate dashboards into something easier to parse. They even offer a free service to proxy your file downloads through their servers to accurately provide download counts.\n\n**Note:** While having analytics _might_ help with getting sponsors for your show, I'd argue it's not really very important in the grand scheme of things. They can be fun to look at, but also something to obsess over or feel bad about if they're not flattering. Their best use is in determining what your audience likes so you can tailor your content accordingly.\n\n<a name=\"sponsors\"></a>\n\n### Sponsors\n\nThis is the dream right? Get paid to make your show!\n\nSponsors could potentially offer you money for ad-spots on the show, sometimes on a cost per mille (CPM) basis. This means a certain amount per thousand listeners per ad-spot.\n\n_Wait, per ***thousand*** listeners?_\n\nYes. The reality is that you're probably not going to be worrying about sponsors at first, and you may never get sponsored.\n\nListen, _I like_ money, _you like_ money, and we all gotta eat. But for our show, until it happens, sponsorship cash is a daydream.\n\nIt's far from free money, by the way. Making ad spots and negotiating with sponsors is also added workload for you, the content creator. And of course, your fans may not appreciate having to listen to ad spots.\n\nAt the end of the day, I make Tech Jr **because I want to** and it's important to me. Helping junior devs is a passion, not a business goal. Hey, if I make a buck along the way, great. If I don't, no sweat. I'm not going to place all my eggs in that basket.\n\nHonestly, podcasting is a great way to telegraph your passion for your niche and establish yourself as an expert in your space. It is impressive on a portfolio or resume, and you end up building a rapport with a lot of great people through interviews. So while there's not necessarily cash benefits to podcasting, there's other value.\n\nThat being said, [there are other ways](https://counterweightcreative.co/ultimate-guide-why-podcast-sponsorships-waste-your-time/) to monetize your show. You can set up a paypal page for donations ([Buy me a coffee?](https://paypal.me/leewarrick)), start a patreon, or be your own advertiser for a service or product you sell (swag anyone?).\n\n<a name=\"audio\"></a>\n\n## Making the Audio Files\n\nAudio quality is incredibly important for your show. You've got a few seconds to hook listeners, and if they hear bad audio, you've probably lost them. Nobody wants to hear to background noise, dead air, or people talking through the microphone equivalent of a potato ü•î (I'm looking at you, built-in laptop mic podcasters).\n\n<a name=\"mic\"></a>\n\n### Choosing a Microphone\n\nIt's easiest to handle audio quality upfront as you record as opposed to afterward in post-production. Using an external microphone will help immensely.\n\nThis could be its own blog post, but basically there's two main categories of microphones that you'll likely be looking at: **dynamic** and **condenser**.\n\nHere's the short version: A **condenser** (Blue yeti, for example) is going to sound very natural, but also pick up **A LOT** of **background noise**. A **dynamic** mic on the other hand (think AM radio, broadcast, reporters, etc), has an adjusted EQ that makes you sound less natural, but also **eliminates most background noise**.\n\nMy recommendation is to get a **dynamic mic** unless you're recording in a studio environment.\n\nThere's also a question of using a USB mic or an XLR mic with an external sound card/interface.\n\nFeel free to splurge on whichever, but I've done just fine with a dynamic USB mic.\n\nAs for my personal mic, I spent a long time reading microphone reviews before landing on a [Samson Q2U](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Handheld-Microphone-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B001R747SG/). (This is almost identical to an [Audio Technica ATR-2100](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100-USB-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B004QJOZS4), by the way.) As a bonus, it also comes with an XLR port if you ever decide to switch to an interface instead of using USB.\n\nMy co-host Eddie uses a high-end XLR dynamic mic into an external interface. To my ears, we both sound good.\n\n#### Helpful Mic Accessories\n\nI'd recommend a windscreen (foam/fur ball that covers the business end) **or** pop filter (a screen that deflects air away), and some type of shock mount (some rubber bands that protect from vibrations from your desk/mic stand).\n\nI also got a cheap boom arm that clamps to my desk to hold the mic in a good spot.\n\nAll that stuff helps minimize background noise and reduce pops/clicks and breathing sounds that are hard to edit out later. These can be had for cheap, costing maybe 20-30 bucks total.\n\n<a name=\"software\"></a>\n\n### Audio Recording and Editing\n\nUnless you're using [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm), you're going to need a way to edit and record your audio.\n\nPersonally, I'm on Windows, and I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for both. It's free, there's tons of info/tutorials out there about it, and it works. ü§∑‚Äç\n\nThere's also [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), which is _not_ free, but has a winrar [price model](https://forlackofabettercomic.tumblr.com/post/26659890193/i-hope-for-all-of-our-sake-that-this-isnt-the) and is awesome.\n\nOther options include Garage band and quicktime on mac, as well as a sleu of other paid DAW (digital audio workstation) programs.\n\nAs far as editing goes, applying a smidge of [compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHA4OPfoi8) is nice for evening out your volume, but don't do too much or you'll remove all the dynamics from the audio. You'll [Ben Stein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP0mQeLWCCo) it. (I use this [plugin](https://theaudacitytopodcast.com/chriss-dynamic-compressor-plugin-for-audacity/) for audacity.)\n\nMainly, you'll want to silence background noise and cut any dead air (periods of silence) during editing, as well as even out your volume with anyone else's.\n\nOr you can pay someone to edit for you. I know another podcaster that has his own [show](https://productivityintech.transistor.fm/) and makes money on the side [editing](https://productivityintech.com/editing) for others.\n\n<a name=\"voip\"></a>\n\n### Interviews, Co-hosts, and Voip\n\nIf your podcast is just you monologuing, feel free to move on. For the rest of us with co-hosts/interview-based shows:\n\nYou can either do everything on-site in the same studio/location (a blue yeti might shine here, it has settings for capturing a room), or you're in my boat: you have to record over the internet.\n\nThis is a rough spot in podcasting. There's not many great free _or_ paid solutions that can account for internet connection issues and speeds. That being said, here's some options:\n\n<a name=\"zoom\"></a>\n\n#### Zoom\n\nZoom is free if you've only got two people on the call, and most folks seem to like using it. However, it _was_ recently blasted for having a zero day security exploit, but has since been patched.\n\nWith Zoom, if you're on a call with 3 or more people, you'll have to pay for a premium account to go beyond 45 minutes, or else the call will drop at that time limit.\n\nThe good news is zoom is able to record your calls and automatically gives you separate audio and video files. (Not separate audio tracks though, and if you talk over each other it will sound wonky)\n\nAlso, if you or anyone else on the call has connection issues, you'll get some funky audio to edit.\n\n<a name=\"skype\"></a>\n\n#### Skype\n\nMost people have used skype at some point or already have it installed. Skype is free and unlimited as far as call length, and will let you record the call (as long as everyone clicks ok when you start recording).\n\nUnfortunately, skype exports a single video file, so you'll have to rip the audio off of that (also on a single track).\n\nDoubly unfortunate is that most people seem to despise skype and have uninstalled and forgotten about it. So they may ask you to please use something else.\n\nOf course, if you or anyone else on the call has connection issues, you'll get some funky audio to edit.\n\n<a name=\"zencastr\"></a>\n\n#### Zencastr\n\n[Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/) is a browser-based voip recording app.\n\nHere's how it works: You set up a session through the website, get a link for all parties to click, and once they do, they're taken to the web app as well. Once there, zencastr provides voip and records through the browser, gives you separate tracks, and even uploads them to a google drive folder for you.\n\nWhen it works, it's fantastic. When it doesn't, your episode is toast üçû.\n\nThey claim to have local backups running, but I've still gotten shortened tracks due to spotty connections.\n\nSo, if you or anyone else on the call has connection issues, you'll _still_ get some funky audio to edit.\n\nLuckily we've had backups going in those situations, but if you have to do backups anyway...\n\n<a name=\"local\"></a>\n\n#### Have everyone record locally\n\nThis is the most reliable solution we've found for our show. We ask our guests to record their own audio and send it to us afterward. Then, we use one of the aforementioned methods as the backup in case the guest makes a mistake recording or just forgets to send their audio.\n\nMost of our guests have a mic and some recording experience, so we've had good luck so far. For the others we use zencastr and üôè.\n\nThe takeaway here is to just make sure you have a backup plan so you're not recording an episode twice.\n\n<a name=\"content\"></a>\n\n## Producing Great Content\n\nThis seems obvious, but you should spend some time making sure what you're saying sounds as good as the audio file it's played from.\n\n<a name=\"topic\"></a>\n\n### Pick a Subject you can Talk about at Length\n\nIf you're doing a Tech podcast, you'll probably always have plenty to talk about. In general though, it's good to pick an evergreen subject so you won't struggle to come up with episodes.\n\nIf you pick a trendy technology or something with too small of a niche, you may struggle to come up with topics.\n\n<a name=\"audience\"></a>\n\n### Consider your Audience\n\nBe sure to tailor content to your listeners. For example, Syntax knows they have lots of new developers listening to their show, so they almost always explain the things they talk about in simple terms for their audience.\n\nIn our case, we're aiming to help early career developers. We try to do the same and provide simple explanations for technical concepts as well as provide career advice geared toward juniors.\n\nThe point here is to produce content your audience wants to hear, and not just talk about the things you want to talk about.\n\n<a name=\"prep\"></a>\n\n### Prepare for your Episodes beforehand\n\nI can't stress this one enough.\n\nI write an outline for every episode that we do on our show.\n\nIt's usually just bullet points of things I want to touch on or questions I hope to ask, but I'll also re-order those bullet points to group things logically by topic. This really helps keep the episode focused and on topic.\n\nAn outline also helps eliminate dead air and \"um\"s or \"uh\"s when trying to think of what to say next.\n\nIt also helps with interviews. Sometimes your guest may ask for your questions beforehand so they can do their own research and preparation. If you have an outline, you can send that to them prior to the interview.\n\n<a name=\"organizing\"></a>\n\n### Staying Organized\n\nThere's a lot to keep track of when podcasting. You've got keep running lists of episode ideas, edits to make, show notes, guests to schedule, etc. It helps to have a system.\n\nI use [trello](https://trello.com) for organizing our episodes, ideas, and keeping track of potential guests.\n\n[Calendly](https://calendly.com) is excellent for allowing guests to schedule a time to be interviewed. I also use google calendar for keeping track of what I need to do and when.\n\nAnother tip is to send an email to any potential guests to prepare them for the interview. You can make a draft/template in gmail that covers:\n* What you will use to record or what they will need to do to record\n* A request to please have a decent quality mic ready\n* A reminder to try and find a quiet environment with a good internet connection\n\nWhen you land an interviewee, make a copy of the draft, tailor it for your guest and send it. You'll save time not having to repeat the same conversation with each guest.\n\n<a name=\"promote\"></a>\n\n## Promoting the Show\n\nI didn't realize I would have to promote my own show when I started.\n\nThere's something incredibly off-putting about trying to pitch and sell your own content to the world, but if you don't get listeners, what's the point?\n\nYou might be thinking, _\"Well, people can subscribe on iTunes and Spotify, and I have an RSS feed, so what else is there to do?\"_\n\nThere's a lot of podcasts out there, and while I wouldn't say you're _competing_ for listeners, your discoverability on those platforms is, well, limited. So it helps to drive listeners to your show through other means.\n\nI am not an expert at this, but I'll share what I know regardless.\n\n<a name=\"social\"></a>\n\n### Social Media\n\nFind out where your audience is, and then go there and **participate in that community**. When you release a new episode, share it.\n\nThe emphasis is because it's much easier to convert any existing followers you have than to build an audience from scratch. Also, simply opening a chat channel and dropping a link is unlikely to net you many listeners and may get you banned.\n\nFor Tech, Twitter is huge. Other shows have told me they promote in Facebook groups. I personally post new episodes in slack groups that I am active in.\n\n**Bonus:** When you're sharing, it also helps if you send out a preview snippet a few days before the episode to build excitement. You can upload a clip to [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com) for free and use that in your tweets. The great thing about this is that soundcloud links are playable in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/TechJrPodcast/status/1148408788661260288)!\n\n<a name=\"seo\"></a>\n\n### SEO\n\nYour website should have proper [schema](https://jsonld.com/) and [metatags](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/) so it's [searchable](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) and [shareable](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).\n\nIt also helps to have transcripts [(Ladybug Devs example)](https://ladybug.dev/episode/web-technologies-were-excited-about/), show notes [(Tech Jr Example)](https://techjr.dev/episodes/2019/travis-neilson-talks-ux-ui-and-the-design-process), or both to help search engines crawl your site (they can't crawl audio) and hopefully point users your way when they're searching.\n\n**Note:** Transcripts are also a thing you really _should_ do so that hearing-impaired folks can get access to your content. There's [ai-powered](https://trint.com) [services](https://otter.ai/) that can help, or you can hire someone.\n\n<a name=\"email\"></a>\n\n### Email and Newsletters\n\nI've noticed a lot of shows have newsletters, so we started our own as well. (Please [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/leewarrick)!) We use [tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com) which is free up to 1,000 subscribers.\n\nI don't have a lot to say about the efficacy of email marketing, but I know that RSS is a **passive** means of notifying your listeners of new episodes, while sending an email with a link is a much more **active** way of engaging your audience.\n\nI personally try to also include other useful things aside from our latest show in emails. This could be other shows we've had guest spots on or have hosts we've interviewed, articles I've read that are useful, funny tweets, etc.\n\n<a name=\"guestspots\"></a>\n\n### Guest Spots and Interviews\n\nCross-promotion is a valuable tactic in your arsenal. Other show hosts will likely be practiced guests and can provide some excellent content. We love interviewing and being guests on other shows!\n\nWhen we interview someone, we add links to that person's podcast, blog, YouTube channel, etc. This helps our fans discover other great material and also helps promote our guests's content. When you're a guest on someone else's show, you'll likely get the same treatment!\n\n**Note:** You might think that netting the biggest fish you can to interview would be your best bet to bootstrap to stardom.\n\nI'm sad to say this isn't always the case.\n\nSuccessful folks are _incredibly_ busy, and don't always remember to promote their own episodes.\n\nI don't blame them though! I'm incredibly thankful to our more famous guests for even finding the time to let us interview them.\n\nWhat I _will_ say though, is that our lesser known guests **almost always** promote our show, sometimes even beyond the episode they were on.\n\nSo interview the little people! They have great stories to tell and your listeners may appreciate being able to relate to guests with less star-power.\n\n<a name=\"ask\"></a>\n\n### Ask your Listeners to Help\n\nThis is another thing I feel weird doing, but I try to ask my listeners to spread the word before and after the show. Something like, _\"If you want to support the show, like, subscribe and leave us a review\"._\n\nIf it feels weird to ask for your audience to help promote... get over yourself and do it anyway üôÉ. It's fairly standard practice, and if your listeners made it to the end of an episode, then chances are they enjoyed it enough to help you out and by leaving a review.\n\nI also occasionally throw out some tweets asking for listeners to spread the word by saying something nice about us.\n\n[Repetition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nagging-repetition-effective-communication-marton-jojarth/) is key here. So be consistent in asking for reviews, subscribes, etc.\n\n<a name=\"reflections\"></a>\n\n## Reflections\n\nTo wrap up, I'd like to add a few personal thoughts and lessons I've learned.\n\n<a name=\"hardwork\"></a>\n\n### It's hard work\n\nYou might have thought podcasting was a simple thing to get into before reading this post.\n\n_\"I'll just record some stuff and put it out there!\"_\n\nHopefully you realize by now that there's a lot that goes into making the podcasts that you love to listen to. Even shows that aren't your favorite took a lot of effort to produce and create.\n\nI'm really awed by some of the amazing shows out there. After creating Tech Jr, I've come to admire all the time and effort podcasters put into their work.\n\n<a name=\"patience\"></a>\n\n### It takes patience\n\nI've seen shows pop up and instantly become sensations. They get thousands of listeners and sponsor offers overnight, etc.\n\nThe thing is, those shows _already had an audience_ that they brought to their new podcast.\n\nIt takes years of effort to build a following and establish a presence with credibility. I struggle with being patient, but I try to remind myself that *these things take time*.\n\n<a name=\"persevere\"></a>\n\n### Prepare for the long game\n\nMost shows don't make it very far.\n\nAccording to [Dan Misener](https://blog.pacific-content.com/podcast-success-a-long-game-fd6522b72752):\n> * 12% of podcasts have only published a single episode\n> * 6% haven‚Äôt made it past two episodes.\n> * Half of all podcasts have 14 or fewer episodes.\n\nThe longer you're at it and the more episodes you make, the higher your chances of success, so don't give up.\n\n<a name=\"feedback\"></a>\n\n### Feedback\n\nPodcasting feels a little like shouting into the void of space at times. Most people don't leave a review or reach out to say whether or not they like the show.\n\n(To the listeners that _do_ reach out though, you're all Rock Stars üé∏ and we love you.)\n\nWe put out about 6 episodes for Tech Jr to little fanfare. It wasn't until I hosted our monthly meetup that I even realized we had listeners.\n\nA few people approached me after the event to shake my hand and tell me how much the show means to them.\n\nIt's a really great feeling to get that feedback, so if you enjoy a podcast, leave them a review, tweet about them, or email them something nice to let them know you appreciate the hard work.\n\n<a name=\"credits\"></a>\n\n## Parting Words\n\nIf reading this post discouraged you from podcasting, that wasn't my intention.\n\nIf you're passionate about it, do it! My aim was to help you succeed by covering all the facets of podcasting you might not have thought about. So I hope this post was helpful and informative. I truly enjoy producing content for Tech Jr, and I hope to be able to continue to do so.\n\nMany thanks to all the other podcasters out there that offer advice and support for our show. And kudos to those podcasters out there that continue to deliver great content.\n\nAnd of course, thank you, reader, for making it through this lengthy post. üëèüòé‚ú®\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/lee/dev/side_projects/blog/content/blog/all-i-know-about-podcasting/index.md"}},"next":{"id":"b2d2c140-a941-5664-8ee5-015d18d9ea8d","fields":{"slug":"/how-to-learn-anything/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learn to Code Anything in 6 Steps"},"body":"\nLearning to code something new can be a painful process. We inevitably get stuck or frustrated as we stumble through new concepts and ideas.\n\nI've learned some hard concepts as a programmer. I've started from scratch in a new language as well as struggled through difficult concepts in an area I'm already comfortable in.\n\nWorking through those challenges has taught me that there's a process to learning to program in a different language or ecosystem. There's a pattern that emerges.\n\nIt's a little like the [five stages of grief](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/); some people are in different spots or skip steps, but everyone struggles through roughly the same process.\n\n## 1. Exposure to a New Topic\n\n![Photo by Aar√≥n Blanco Tejedor of mural of man in pain](./pain.jpg)\n\nWhen you're first introduced to a completely new concept, it can be overwhelming.\n\nHandlebars templating stopped me dead in my tracks when I was in a code bootcamp.\n\nMy brain hurt. It was difficult to comprehend this concept, and my body was physically telling me to give up. I found it hard to read about, and I didn't want to listen in class or do the examples. When it came time to do the homework, I had to force myself to sit down and do it.\n\nEventually though, I got the hang of handlebars.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize and find comfort in the fact that this feeling of despair when facing a new, challenging task is temporary. It goes away with time and patience.\n\nWhen you find yourself faced with an overwhelming task or topic, think of yourself like a sculptor. A sculptor can't produce a large piece in an afternoon with a sledgehammer; she has to chisel away slowly to transform the unforgiving rock into art. Hard topics are boulders we try to sculpt into artful understanding slowly over time.\n\nYou need rest, patience, and persistence to learn what at first feels insurmountable.\n\n## 2. Developing a High-level Understanding\n\nMany tutorials and guides zero in on the syntax and finite steps required to accomplish something. This is great if you're a veteran and well-versed in the subject matter.\n\nSo as a guitarist I might watch a 10 minute video and walk away with,\n\n> _\"Ah, so one major pentatonic scale cannot be applied universally to a chord progression. To sound good I have  to match the scale to the specific chord being played._\n\n> _I can accomplish that by using CAGED patterns to match  up with the chords in a progression.\"_\n\nAnd I get it, but I've played guitar for about 20 years. If you're not a guitarist or not familiar with basic music theory, that tip is gibberish to you.\n\nLooking back at the handlebars example, I had to come to grips with a lot of foreign concepts.\n\nI had to understand browsers, http, servers, databases, and client-side vs server-side rendering. I also had to learn what node and npm are, what package managers are, and how to work with modules in node.\n\nI had to understand all of these things to understand the problem that handlebars was created to solve. Once I understood those things, it was easier to focus on handlebars itself, as opposed to the ecosystem it lives in.\n\nIf you find yourself completely lost on a concept, ask yourself:\n\n_\"Do I not understand this because it is complex, or do I not understand this because I don't understand the things that surround it?\"_\n\nThere are many times I've run up against this:\n\n* PassportJS - I didn't know how auth worked, how sessions worked, or how/what OAuth was, so passport was wizardry.\n* Docker - I didn't know what a virtual machine was or why it was useful, therefore didn't understand containers.\n* AWS - I didn't understand what \"cloud architecture\" was, so I didn't understand what it meant to deploy code in the cloud.\n\nSeeking out high-level explanations for those topics and understanding them first was key to allowing me to learn how to use those tools.\n\n## 3. Learning the Workflow\n\nWith a new coding skill usually comes a new workflow.\n\nYou're going to have to spend time figuring out how to edit and run your code, how to use other people's code, and what tooling fits your use case.\n\nThis is often a **boring**, ***miserable*** task.\n\nTo give an example, I've recently been learning Python. I immediately had questions:\n\n1. Which version should I install, 2 or 3?\n1. Can I edit and run Python with VSCode?\n1. What the heck is a REPL?\n1. How do I manage dependencies? Why do they install globally instead of locally by default?\n1. What are virtual environments?\n1. What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n1. How do I run a Jupyter notebook file? _...Oh, hmmm. It comes with Anaconda_\n1. What is anaconda?\n1. Ananconda COMES with a Python installation!? üò´\n\nThen I had to go back to step 2 and work through most of the same questions with conda ü§¶‚Äç\n\nA lot tutorial makers and authors skip these crucial tidbits. Whether this is because they don't think their audience needs to be told the basics, or because they want to skip to the üî• **hot tips** üî•, I couldn't say.\n\nWhat I *can* say is that if you don't need the handholding, it's easy to skim further or skip that part of a tutorial. If you *do* need that extra instruction and it isn't there, you're now lost.\n\nPersonally, I really appreciate whenever someone takes the time to build the audience up to a topic and provides some clear, concise steps to follow to get up and running. It's a huge time-saver and let's me get right into the part I enjoy, which is coding.\n\nSo do your research and try to stay motivated while you're working though this part. It's easy to say, _\"Ugh, forget it, I'll figure out npm another day\"_, and then give up on learning Node.\n\nHowever, once you get past this boring part of the process, you can start to learn the fun parts. ü¶Ñ\n\n**NOTE:** If you're looking for a blog post topic, this is a great start. I **guarantee** that the workflow knowledge you take for granted is crucial to a novice's continued learning out there. You probably know more than you think you do, so share it.\n\n## 4. Defining a Small, Attainable Goal\n\n![Photo by Kelly Sikkema of a child building a rocket ship out of legos](./lego.jpg)\n\nOnce you've got a good workflow and can actually execute the code you're writing, it's time to figure out something to build.\n\nThis seems obvious, but it's actually a crucial step.\n\nYou need to scope yourself to something achieveable, but also useful and fun to build. Something that will challenge you, but not so much that you give up.\n\nIf you're learning web development, you don't want to start out trying to build a facebook clone. You're going to be sent down so many rabbit holes (servers, databases, react, etc) you'll never get anything accomplished.\n\nAs a beginner, you probably want to stick to HTML and just build a basic site. If you have a little knowledge, maybe use HTML and CSS to make a site with a nice layout and design. If that's too easy, maybe add in some interactivity with JavaScript.\n\nAgain, this seems simple, but can be devilishly challenging if you're entering a new area or subject. How do you know what's too complex? What's actually useful to learn?\n\nYou have to spend some time figuring out what your actual goals are for learning this new skill, then work backwards. What would you like to be able to build? What will you need to learn to build it? How can you practice those things?\n\nAs a guitarist, I started taking lessons as a young adult after about ten years of study. At that point I knew about scales, chords, how to play a song, etc. I knew all the basics.\n\nI sat down across from my new teacher one night and he asked me, _\"What would you like to learn?\"_\n\nI had no idea. He didn't either. How could he teach me?\n\nAvoiding the creation of clearly-defined goals often leads to a lot of wasted time.\n\n## 5. Putting in the Work\n\nCoding is hard. Building useful things out of code is harder. Even veteran programmers struggle:\n\n>20+ yrs dev exp, 8 books w/ 100k+ copies sold, 300k+ hours watched of my videos, 4k+ taught in person...\n\n>And you know what? I still struggle to get my code to work and it's still a tedious slog. And my code still confuses me the next day.\n\n>You're not alone in these struggles. - [Kyle Simpson](https://twitter.com/getify/status/972495616600293381)\n\nBuilding that first project is going to be tough. You're going to hit some snags, discover you need to dive into some new topics, and probably end up on stack overflow more than once.\n\nBut you're going to learn a lot of things if you get it done.\n\nThe important thing here is to realize that you need to keep at it, and that if you planned correctly in the previous step, there's an end in sight.\n\nJust remember that finishing that first project and realizing you've built something with an entirely new skill, language, or framework is...\n\n‚ú®üéµüïä**G L O R I O U S**üïäüéµ‚ú®\n\n## 6. Maintaining Momentum\n\n![Photo by Brian Erickson of running on a mountain pass](./hiking.jpg)\n\nOnce you have that first win, it's time to get another under your belt.\n\nüòÆ *So soon?*, you say.\n\n**Yes.** üòê\n\nGo back to the previous two steps and start figuring out what you can build next that will get you further toward your goal. (You _do_ have a goal, right?)\n\nFigure out how you can expand what you've learned and take those new skills into the next project. Build something bigger or completely different that's going to teach you a little bit more about how to reach that end goal.\n\nThen build it. Build more things. **Keep learning.**\n\nWe signed up for this life when we decided to become developers. It's the bargain we made for a great job with widely-applicable skills. We accepted that we would be constantly learning and growing, that we would continue to hone our skills in an ever-changing industry.\n\nThe good news is that this process becomes easier. You begin to expect it.\n\n_\"Gosh, this is hard. This hurts my brain\"_\n\nBecomes: _\"Ah, yes. This will take some time to learn.\"_\n\n_\"Ugh, where do I start?\"_\n\nBecomes: _\"Hmm, better figure out a workflow.\"_\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI've been through these steps myself many times as a developer. You'll get faster if you keep going.","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/lee/dev/side_projects/blog/content/blog/how-to-learn-anything/index.md"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Debug JavaScript Quickly","date":"2019-08-11T23:00:00-0400"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2836739900","4250957540"],"slicesMap":{}}
